# CS50x Projects – Harvard University (2025)

This repository contains my solutions to the first 5 problem sets of [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course.

Each project showcases concepts like visual programming, C programming, arrays, algorithms, and more. All work is completed as part of the 2025 CS50x curriculum and reflects my personal learning and progress.
